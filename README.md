- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and tuning
- Deployment of ML models
- Model evaluation
- A/B testing and validation
- Data pipelines

## Mini Projects

The mini-projects provided practical applications of machine learning concepts, allowing for an iterative understanding of core ML workflows. Below are some highlights:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**  
   Techniques and scripts to clean raw datasets, handle missing values, standardize data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Methods for transforming features, encoding categorical variables, and engineering new features to enhance model performance.

3. **Model Selection and Evaluation**  
   Experimenting with different algorithms like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, along with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Using k-fold cross-validation and Grid Search/Randomized Search for optimizing model parameters.
